Why DH centres and libraries?

What challenges?
 * staffing
 * culture

Who's the audience?
 * Faculty?
 * Postdoc-y types?
 * grads?
 * undergrads?

Public versus academic libraries?
 * Different approaches or the same fundamental ideas?
 * hackerspace = public, DH centre = academic? or can cross-pollination exist?

What sort of work?
 * research wonkery?
 * replicatable, practical?
 * mix?

Miscellaneous thoughts
* Gender and the hackerspace - The sausagefest effect.
    * some (Oakland?) place has all-female hackerspace. Good? Bad? 
* Perceived emphasis on electronics/STEM fields. What of the crafters, artisans, etc.?
* Jack-of-all-trades versus subject specialists: Do we all need to be coders? 
* The library/DH centre as a place of knowledge creation.

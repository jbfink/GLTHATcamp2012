title: "Turning Libraries into Hackerspaces"

description: "Libraries have always been in the midst of change, from the advent of the written word right up until the coming of the Internet. With Wikipedia, ebooks, and other avenues of seemingly limitless information at nearly everyone's fingertips, libraries have never been as poised to sink-or-swim as they are today. The time is ripe for libraries and library workers to start hacking their own path to a DIY future. Join us as we figure out ways to transform the library, the library worker, and the library patron from consumers into producers."
